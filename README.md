# C-playground
A little sandbox repository for me to play around with C. This code is for purely educational reasons. **Do not use this code for real projects**.

## Contents
This repo contains a few things.
* Some basic datastructures.
* C implementations of some algoriths (Labs from course EDAF05@LTH)
* Solutions to exercises for *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan & Ritchie
